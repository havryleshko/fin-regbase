## 2026-04-10 ingest | FCA PS22/9 — A New Consumer Duty: Feedback to CP21/36 and Final Rules

Source: `raw/fca-consumer-duty/ps22-9.pdf` (FCA Policy Statement, July 2022, 83pp + annexes)

Pages created (9):
- `wiki/summaries/ps22-9-policy-statement.md`
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-overview.md`
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-principle.md`
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-cross-cutting-rules.md`
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-products-services.md`
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-price-value.md`
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-consumer-understanding.md`
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-consumer-support.md`
- `wiki/concepts/vulnerable-customers.md`

Notes:
- No contradictions with existing wiki pages (first ingest).
- PS22/9 is the policy statement; the accompanying non-Handbook guidance is FG22/5 (not yet ingested — referenced in pages but not sourced).
- The made rules text (Appendix 1 of PS22/9) was not separately ingested; rule citations in wiki pages reference the PS22/9 policy chapters, not the PRIN 2A rule numbers directly. A future ingest of FG22/5 should add rule-level citations.

## 2026-04-10 ingest | FCA FG22/5 — Final Non-Handbook Guidance for Firms on the Consumer Duty

Source: `raw/fca-consumer-duty/fg22-5.pdf` (FCA Finalised Guidance, July 2022, 120pp)

Pages created (2):
- `wiki/summaries/fg22-5-guidance.md`
- `wiki/concepts/sludge-and-friction.md`
- `wiki/derived/fca-supervisory-questions-consumer-duty.md`

Pages updated (4):
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-overview.md` — added sector-specific retail customer scope table (FG22/5 §2.3); professional client opt-up breach point (FG22/5 §2.10)
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-cross-cutting-rules.md` — added bad-faith pattern catalogue (FG22/5 §5.12–§5.13); foreseeable harm examples list (FG22/5 §5.23); signposting for declined customers (FG22/5 §5.40–§5.41)
- `wiki/concepts/consumer-duty-consumer-support.md` — added sludge/positive friction section and at-least-as-easy-to-exit rule (FG22/5 §9.20–§9.28); FCA supervisory questions for this outcome
- `wiki/concepts/vulnerable-customers.md` — added four-driver culture model (FG22/5 §10.6); enhanced monitoring approaches incl. proxy data, focus groups, staff networks (FG22/5 §11.42); GDPR special category data basis (FG22/5 §11.40)

Notes:
- No contradictions with existing PS22/9 pages. FG22/5 adds operational detail that was absent from PS22/9 rather than conflicting with it.
- Sludge and positive friction are FG22/5-only concepts — neither term appears in PS22/9 or the PRIN 2A rules.
- The four-driver culture model (Purpose, Leadership, People, Governance) is FG22/5-only guidance, not a made rule.
- Supervisory questions in `derived/fca-supervisory-questions-consumer-duty.md` are drawn verbatim from FG22/5 Ch.6–10 "Key questions for firms" sections.
